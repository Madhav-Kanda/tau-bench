6,7,"The agent miscounted the number of available T-shirt variants. The tool response listed 12 variants, of which only 10 are marked ""available"", yet the agent told the user there were 11 available options. This is information not supported by the tool data.","At step 7 the assistant states there are 11 available T-shirt options, which contradicts the data returned in step 6 (10 available variants). This constitutes a hallucinated/incorrect fact."
6,7,"The assistant counted the available T-shirt variants incorrectly and told the user there were 11 available options, whereas the product details show only 10 available (12 variants total, 2 unavailable). This is a factual error not grounded in the retrieved data.","At step 7 the assistant states: ""Currently, there are 11 available T-shirt options…"", which contradicts the data returned in the previous tool call that shows only 10 available variants."
3,11,"When the user asked about T-shirt options, the agent should first have fetched product details for product_id 6086499569 (per the ground-truth sequence) but instead skipped that call and went straight to listing all product types. This shows the agent generated an incorrect plan of tool calls.","At step 11 the agent issued list_all_product_types instead of the required get_product_details call for product_id 6086499569, indicating the wrong plan was chosen."
4,19,"The assistant skipped the mandatory step of listing the return details and obtaining the user’s explicit confirmation (including the desired refund payment method) before executing a consequential action. It prematurely called return_delivered_order_items and chose the credit-card refund instead of asking and using the user’s PayPal, violating policy requirements.","At message index 19 the assistant directly executed the return_delivered_order_items tool call without prior confirmation and with the wrong payment_method_id, constituting the incorrect execution of the plan."
3,49,"The assistant incorrectly assumed that an order with status ""processed"" could be exchanged. It generated a plan to exchange items from order #W4967593 and then executed the invalid tool call, which failed because only DELIVERED orders are exchange-eligible. This shows faulty reasoning in the planning phase, not merely a slip in execution.","At step 49 the assistant tries `exchange_delivered_order_items` on order #W4967593, which is in status ""processed"" rather than ""delivered"", violating policy. The incorrect assumption shows the plan itself was wrong."
4,41,"When modifying the pending order, the agent executed the modification without first asking the user which payment method should be used to pay the price difference (policy requires the user to supply or confirm a payment method). The agent unilaterally chose PayPal and submitted the tool call with that method, violating the policy for modifying items in a pending order.","At step 41 the agent makes the modify_pending_order_items tool call using the PayPal account without having requested or obtained the user’s payment-method choice, hence executing the plan incorrectly."
3,31,"The assistant misinterpreted the user’s request to cancel only one item in a pending order and proceeded with cancelling the entire order. According to policy, individual-item cancellation is not supported; the assistant should have explained this instead of starting a full-order cancellation workflow. This shows the assistant chose the wrong approach (plan) rather than executing a correct plan wrongly.","At step 31 the assistant asks the user to confirm cancellation of only the garden hose from the pending order, implying it can cancel a single item, which violates policy and leads to the incorrect subsequent action."
3,29,"After the user asked to simply change the shipping destination to the NYC address, the agent ended the conversation without calling the modify_pending_order_address tool, which was the appropriate next action according to policy and ground-truth sequence.","At step 29 the assistant replied with confirmation instead of invoking modify_pending_order_address, showing it never generated the correct plan to fulfill the updated user request."
6,17,"The assistant incorrectly stated that it could not obtain the customer’s new address from any order information, claiming that orders ""only reflect the current default address."" In fact, the assistant could have called get_order_details (e.g., for order #W5285031) to retrieve the shipping address on that order, confirm it with the user, and then proceed to modify the default address. This fabricated limitation led the assistant to abandon the requested address-update task.","At step 17 the assistant asserted a false claim about its inability to pull an address from order details, which is not supported by the tool capabilities described in the system policy. This hallucinated restriction prevented it from taking the correct next step (calling get_order_details, then modify_user_address)."
3,17,"The agent changed the item first (modify_pending_order_items) even though doing so locks the order into ""pending (item modified)"", preventing any further modifications like correcting the address that the user also wanted. The agent should have updated the address first and then modified the item, or warned the user of the consequence. This shows the agent devised an incorrect action sequence rather than merely executing it wrongly.","At step 17 the agent calls modify_pending_order_items before fixing the address, contrary to the policy that no further modifications are allowed once items are modified. This incorrect planning leads to the failure."
3,19,"The assistant escalated the user to a human agent instead of completing the return, even though the return request was fully within the agent’s allowed scope. The user’s request for faster refund could simply have been politely declined while still processing the return.","At step 19 the assistant calls transfer_to_human_agents, showing the incorrect plan (escalation rather than calling return_delivered_order_items)."
3,33,"When initiating the return for order #W4597054, the assistant omitted the Water Bottle (item_id 6777246137).  According to policy the agent must ensure all items to be returned are collected in one call (and remind the customer if necessary).  The ground-truth call includes this item, but the assistant’s call at step 33 does not, so the plan it generated for the return is incomplete/incorrect.","At step 33 the assistant calls return_delivered_order_items with only three item_ids instead of the required four, showing the incorrect plan."
3,19,"The agent carried out the wrong high-impact actions compared with what should have been done: it canceled order #W2702727 (step 19) and later modified the address for #W8268610, while the correct sequence required canceling #W8268610 and updating #W2702727. This indicates the agent formed an incorrect plan about which order to act on.","The first erroneous action appears at step 19 where the assistant calls cancel_pending_order on #W2702727 instead of the required #W8268610, showing the plan itself was wrong."
4,31,"The agent identified the cheaper variant the customer wanted but never executed the required actions (calculate the new total and call modify_pending_order_items). The correct next step after the customer’s request was to replace the existing speaker with the cheaper variant and compute the new order total, but the agent only discussed the change and asked for confirmation, then dropped the action altogether. Thus, the plan was correct but the execution (tool calls) was missing.","At step 31 the agent should have proceeded with the calculate and modify_pending_order_items tool calls (after effectively having enough confirmation from the user’s intent to replace the speaker) but instead merely replied with text, so the expected tool calls were never made."
3,27,"The assistant prematurely executed modify_pending_order_items after the user requested one item change (desk lamp) without first confirming whether the customer had any other item changes, violating the policy that the item-modification tool can only be used once and that the agent must remind the customer to confirm all items. This led to inability to satisfy the later backpack change that the ground-truth expected.","At step 27 the assistant makes the modify_pending_order_items call for the desk lamp before ensuring (and obtaining confirmation) that the customer had provided all desired item modifications, contrary to policy and ground-truth expectation (which required changing the backpack instead)."
3,21,"The assistant generated an incorrect modification plan: it bundled two item changes (desk lamp included though user later only wanted backpack), failed to update the shipping address, and chose the gift card payment method without confirmation. This diverges from the required sequence (first modify address, then modify only backpack with PayPal) and violates policy confirmation steps.","At step 21 the assistant made a wrong modify_pending_order_items tool call (wrong items and payment method) instead of first modifying the address, confirming details, and using PayPal as intended."
4,21,"The agent attempted to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool even though it had already learned that the order status was ""pending"". Exchanging is only allowed on delivered orders; for a pending order the correct action would be to use the modify-items flow. Thus the agent executed the wrong tool call for the situation.","At step 21 the assistant calls `exchange_delivered_order_items` on a pending order, violating policy and causing the tool to error."
4,26,"After the user explicitly confirmed the exchange and asked the assistant to finalize it, the assistant never made the required exchange_delivered_order_items tool call. The conversation simply ends without carrying out the necessary action.","At this point the assistant should have executed the exchange by calling exchange_delivered_order_items, but no assistant response (and no tool call) follows the user's confirmation."
3,23,"The agent misunderstood what items should be returned.  According to the ground-truth, the correct action was a single call returning ALL items from order #W9571698, but the agent instead planned and initiated two separate returns, one for a tablet from order #W3069600 and only the tablet (not the whole order) from #W9571698.  This shows the agent generated the wrong plan before execution.","At step 23 the agent issues the first return_delivered_order_items call for order #W3069600, which is not required; the correct plan would have been one call covering every item in order #W9571698."
3,31,"The user asked to update all of their pending orders. There are three pending orders (#W2166301, #W2466703, #W6832752). The assistant only planned to update two of them (#W2166301 and #W2466703) and therefore never issued the required tool call for #W6832752, omitting it from the updates.","At step 31 the assistant began executing the modification calls, but its plan only included two orders, demonstrating it had already formed an incomplete plan that ignored #W6832752."
4,40,"After the user explicitly approved the plan, the agent never executed the required return_delivered_order_items and exchange_delivered_order_items tool calls. The conversation ends without performing the actions the ground-truth expects.","Following the user's confirmation at step 40, the assistant should immediately begin making the necessary tool calls, but no assistant turn appears after this point."
3,21,"The agent modified the items in the pending order first, which immediately moved the order into the special status ""pending (item modified)"". According to the policy, once an order reaches this status no further modifications (including address changes or cancellation) are allowed. The correct plan (as indicated by the ground-truth sequence) was to change the shipping address first with modify_pending_order_address, and only then modify the items. By choosing the wrong order of operations the agent made it impossible to fulfill the user’s subsequent address-update and cancellation requests.","At step 21 the agent calls modify_pending_order_items before updating the address, locking the order against further changes. This reflects an incorrect plan rather than an execution mistake, because the policy clearly warns that item modification should be the last action and the ground truth expects the address change first."
4,35,"When processing the camera exchange the agent called exchange_delivered_order_items with payment_method_id ""credit_card_8105988"" (Mastercard) but the ground-truth expected the refund to go to ""credit_card_3951670"" (Visa). Everything else matched the required arguments, so the plan was correct but executed with an incorrect argument value.",The incorrect payment method was supplied in the function arguments at step 35.
