6,7,"The product details returned by the tool show 12 variants of the T-Shirt, of which 2 are unavailable – therefore only 10 variants are available.  In its answer the agent told the user there were 11 available options, inventing an incorrect number not grounded in the tool data.","At step 7 the agent states: “Currently, there are 11 available T-shirt options…”.  The tool output in step 6 clearly indicates only 10 variants are available (12 total variants, 2 unavailable).  Thus the agent hallucinated an incorrect fact."
3,3,"The agent responded to the user’s first request about T-shirt options by immediately calling product-lookup tools without first authenticating the user’s identity, which the policy requires at the beginning of every conversation. Hence the agent’s overall plan was incorrect from the outset.","At step 3 the assistant makes a product tool call without asking for or verifying the user’s identity, violating the required authentication step, indicating faulty plan generation."
3,15,"The user asked for the total number of T-shirt options in the whole store. The ground-truth path shows that the agent should have queried TWO different T-shirt product IDs (9523456873 and 6086499569) before answering. The agent only retrieved details for one product (9523456873) and therefore replied that there are 11 options, giving an incorrect answer.",At step 15 the assistant answers the user with an incorrect count after having fetched only one product’s variants instead of both T-shirt products required by the task.
3,19,"The assistant initiated the return_delivered_order_items tool call without first collecting a valid refund payment method from the user and obtaining explicit confirmation, and it selected the wrong payment_method_id (credit card instead of PayPal as in ground-truth). This violates required procedure and differs from expected call arguments.","At step 19 the assistant makes the return_delivered_order_items call immediately, using the credit-card ID, without asking the user for a refund method or getting explicit confirmation. The ground-truth shows the call should have used the PayPal ID after gathering that information."
3,21,The assistant incorrectly classified orders #W4967593 and #W5733668 (status = processed) as “delivered” and built a plan to exchange them. This violates the policy that only delivered orders can be exchanged and led to erroneous tool calls and subsequent errors.,"At step 21 the assistant states that orders #W4967593 and #W5733668 are delivered and proposes to exchange them, showing the incorrect plan that causes later failures."
3,41,"The assistant executed a modification of the pending order without following the policy requirements: • It did not explicitly ask the user which payment method to use (it defaulted to PayPal although a gift-card with sufficient balance existed and the user later wanted that). • It failed to remind the user that ALL desired changes must be gathered before the single allowed modify_pending_order_items call. • Consequently, it made the tool call with only one item and with the wrong payment method, preventing any later correction.This shows the assistant produced an incorrect sequence of steps for the user’s intent (order modification).","At step 41 the assistant calls modify_pending_order_items immediately, using PayPal, without confirming payment method or whether there are any other items to modify, violating the policy that this call may be used only once and that all items and payment details must be finalized first."
4,33,"The user asked to cancel only the Garden Hose in the pending order #W2575533, but the assistant executed cancel_pending_order which cancels the entire order, thereby performing an action the user did not request.","At step 33 the assistant calls cancel_pending_order, cancelling the whole order instead of just the requested item, demonstrating incorrect execution of the plan."
3,29,"After the user asked to have the whole order shipped to the NYC address, the assistant stated that it would ship there but never performed the required modify_pending_order_address tool call (and did not even ask for confirmation). The order was still set to ship to Seattle, so the assistant both misunderstood the situation and failed to carry out the needed action.","At step 29 the assistant concludes the conversation, claims the order will ship to the NYC address, and does not issue the modify_pending_order_address tool call that the ground-truth sequence requires."
3,17,The agent incorrectly assumed it could not obtain the customer’s new address from existing order information and therefore never attempted to call get_order_details or proceed to update the address. This shows that the agent generated the wrong plan for fulfilling the user’s request (it should have pulled the address from the order and then called modify_user_address).,"At step 17 the assistant states it cannot fetch the user’s new address from order details and stops pursuing the address-update flow, demonstrating an incorrect plan before execution."
3,17,"The agent modified the order items FIRST (step 17), which changes the order status to 'pending (item modified)', preventing any further address modifications. This incorrect sequence caused the subsequent address-update call (step 19) to fail and left the user’s address unresolved. The correct plan would have updated the address for both orders (and the user profile) before modifying items.","Step 17 shows the agent calling modify_pending_order_items before fixing the shipping address. This wrong ordering violates the policy that no further modifications are allowed after an item-modification action, leading to the later failure."
3,19,"After authenticating the user and identifying the correct delivered order, the assistant should have proceeded to create the return request once the user confirmed the items. Instead, it prematurely transferred the conversation to a human agent, never calling `return_delivered_order_items`. This shows the assistant generated an incorrect overall plan for handling the user’s request.","At step 19 the assistant invokes `transfer_to_human_agents` instead of creating the return request with `return_delivered_order_items`, diverging from the expected tool-call sequence."
3,33,"When initiating the return for order #W4597054 the assistant omitted the Water Bottle (item_id 6777246137).  The ground-truth action requires all four delivered items to be included in the return, but the assistant’s plan and subsequent tool-call only listed three items.  Hence the sequence of steps it generated for the user’s intent is incorrect.","At step 33 the assistant calls return_delivered_order_items with only three item_ids, missing the Water Bottle that should also be returned according to the correct action sequence."
3,23,"The assistant changed the shipping address of pending order #W8268610 without first listing the action details and obtaining an explicit user confirmation, which the policy requires before any database-changing action. This shows the assistant generated the wrong sequence of steps for the task.","At step 23 the assistant directly invoked the modify_pending_order_address tool without first presenting the action details and asking the user to confirm (""yes"") as mandated."
3,23,"The assistant incorrectly declared that it could not cancel or modify a single item in a pending order and therefore refused to proceed, while the correct plan (per ground-truth) was to use modify_pending_order_items to swap the speaker for the cheaper variant (or otherwise adjust the item list). This shows the plan it generated for handling the user’s request was wrong.","At step 23 the assistant states: “Unfortunately, I cannot cancel individual items from an order. I can only cancel the entire pending order …”. This contradicts the allowed actions (modify_pending_order_items) and prevents the correct sequence of tool calls from being executed."
3,27,"The agent prematurely used the single allowed modify_pending_order_items call to change only the desk lamp without first confirming whether the user had any other item modifications. Later, when the user wanted to change the backpack, the agent could no longer comply. Correct procedure required collecting all desired item changes before invoking the tool.","At step 27 the agent invoked modify_pending_order_items for the lamp without first asking the customer if there were any additional item changes, violating the one-call rule and leading to inability to fulfill the later backpack request."
3,21,"The assistant executed an incorrect sequence: it prematurely made the modify_pending_order_items tool call (changing BOTH backpack and desk-lamp and using the gift card) before first updating the shipping address and before confirming payment method, contrary to the requested and required flow. This diverged from the ground-truth calls (address change first, then only backpack via PayPal).","At step 21 the assistant issued modify_pending_order_items with wrong items and payment method, showing its plan was incorrect compared with user intent and policy."
4,21,The agent attempted to call the exchange_delivered_order_items tool for an order that was still in “pending” status. Exchanges are only permitted for delivered orders; for a pending order the agent should have planned a modify_pending_order_items call. Hence the agent executed the wrong tool call.,"At step 21 the assistant issued the tool call exchange_delivered_order_items on order #W5166363 even though the order status was pending, violating policy and causing the tool to return an error."
4,26,"After the user explicitly confirmed the exchange, the assistant failed to execute the required tool call (exchange_delivered_order_items). The dialogue ends without performing the requested action.","At index 26 the user gives final confirmation, so the assistant’s next turn should have invoked the exchange_delivered_order_items function, but no such call (or any assistant response) follows."
3,23,"The agent misunderstood the correct items/order that should be returned. According to the ground-truth, the agent should have submitted a single return for ALL items in order #W9571698 and not touched order #W3069600, but instead it (a) issued a return for order #W3069600 and (b) only returned one item from #W9571698. Thus the plan it generated (what to return and for which order) was wrong.","At step 23 the assistant initiates the first wrong tool call, returning the tablet from order #W3069600, which should not have been returned at all per the ground-truth plan."
3,31,"The agent failed to update the address for the third pending order (#W6832752). Ground-truth requires a modify_pending_order_address call for this order, but the agent only updated two pending orders and the default address, omitting the third pending order despite retrieving its details.","At step 31 the agent begins executing address updates but only includes order #W2166301 (and later #W2466703 & user address), never adding #W6832752, showing the plan it generated was incomplete."
4,40,"After explicitly receiving the user’s go-ahead in step 40, the assistant never executed the required tool calls to (1) return the three items from order #W7553978 and (2) exchange the item(s) from order #W3239882. The conversation ends without any tool invocation, so the intended actions were not carried out.",The lapse becomes evident immediately after the user’s confirmation in step 40: the next assistant turn that should have contained the tool calls is missing.
3,21,"The agent modified order items first, even though policy and correct sequence required updating the shipping address before modifying items (item-modification locks the order). This prevented the subsequent address change and deviated from the ground-truth order of tool calls.","At step 21 the agent calls modify_pending_order_items before changing the address, leading to the order becoming 'pending (item modified)' and blocking further modifications."
4,35,"When performing the camera exchange (#W4689314) the assistant invoked exchange_delivered_order_items with payment_method_id ""credit_card_8105988"" (Mastercard 8484), whereas the ground-truth action requires the refund to be processed to ""credit_card_3951670"" (Visa 6791). The incorrect argument shows the assistant executed the action with the wrong payment method.",The wrong payment method is supplied in the tool call at this step.
