3,5,2,"The agent failed to make the required tool call to get details about all T-shirt variants (product_id 6086499569) and only retrieved product details for product_id 9523456873. This means the information provided about T-shirt variants may be incomplete or inaccurate according to the ground truth, which requires both product_ids to be queried."
3,3,3,"The assistant failed to request the user's authentication at the very beginning, as required by policy. Instead, it answered a general product availability question (step 3) without verifying the user's identity. According to the policy, user authentication must occur at the start of the conversation, even if the user provides a user ID up front."
4,8,4,"The agent failed to call get_user_details after retrieving the user_id, which is required immediately after authentication to comply with the policy and the ground truth tool call sequence. This occurred right after receiving the user id from find_user_id_by_name_zip."
4,19,12,"The agent executed the return for the delivered order using the Visa card as the refund payment method, despite the user having a PayPal payment method and explicitly requesting to use it. According to the policy, refunds for returns can go to either the original payment method or an existing gift card, so the agent should have attempted to process the refund to PayPal when requested by the user. This is a mistake in plan execution."
3,61,20,"The agent attempted to exchange items in order #W5733668, which was in 'processed' status, not 'delivered', and so not eligible for exchange. Instead, after thoroughly exploring tool options, the agent should have followed the correct policy: only attempt to upgrade pending orders and delivered orders, not processed orders. The agent wasted tool calls and user effort attempting to exchange items in both 'processed' orders (#W4967593 and #W5733668), leading to errors."
4,41,21,"The agent only modified one item (the mechanical keyboard) instead of both items (the running shoes and the keyboard), even though according to the ground truth, both should have been changed at once in a single modify_pending_order_items call. The agent proceeded with the user intent to replace only the keyboard, missing the requirement to collect all changes before making the call and thus executed the modification incorrectly."
5,31,28,"The agent hallucinated the procedure for cancelling pending orders by claiming that it is possible to cancel just one item from a pending order (#W2575533) rather than the entire order, and led the user to believe only the garden hose would be cancelled. In reality, the cancellation of a pending order results in the cancellation of the entire order, not individual items. This misinformation happened at step 31."
3,11,32,"When the user asked for the tracking number for a tablet she received, the agent looked up and returned the tracking number 194496721133, which is for order #W7449508. However, according to the ground truth, the actual corresponding tracking number for the tablet (from order #W2692684) is 746342064230. The agent failed to check all relevant orders and their item details to locate the correct tracking number for the tablet. Instead, the agent provided the tracking number for unrelated items (Espresso Machine and Sneakers). This represents an incorrect plan generation—choosing the wrong order and tracking information."
3,13,34,"The assistant incorrectly interpreted the user's request by attempting to remove only certain items from a pending order using the item modification tool, which the system does not support. According to policy, if the user wanted to keep the order but ship everything to a new address, the correct flow would have been to offer to change the shipping address for the entire order, not partially modify items. The agent also failed to collect all relevant orders to ensure no other associated pending orders needed address updates, as indicated by the ground truth tool call sequence (which included address modification). This represents a failure of correct plan generation."
3,37,38,"The agent fetched the cheapest option for 'T-Shirt' after 'Backpack', but made the tool call for 'T-Shirt' after 'Backpack', when by ground truth order it should have been before. More significantly, during the step where the agent is to calculate the total of the cheapest variants, it omits the Patio Umbrella (product_id: 9743693396), resulting in an incorrect calculation (using 466.75 + 285.66 + 135.24 + 46.66 + 193.38 instead of 466.75 + 288.82 + 135.24 + 193.38 + 46.66). This leads to a total that does not match the actual minimum possible. The correct plan would call get_product_details in the correct sequence and sum the right items. The error is in planning the calculation and order of tool calls."
3,17,39,"When the user provided only the city and zip code for their new address and asked if the agent could retrieve the full details from the order history, the agent incorrectly said that it could not proceed without the full details, claiming order details only reflect the current default address. In reality, as per the system’s available tools, the agent should have called 'get_order_details' to check for previously delivered orders to potentially suggest the new address, or at least attempt to retrieve any relevant information, as a path to better assisting the user with their address update."
4,17,41,"The agent executed the 'modify_pending_order_items' tool call (step 17) before updating the order shipping address, despite task policy and tool restrictions indicating that once the items are modified, the order becomes 'pending (item modified)' and address can no longer be updated. The correct plan should have been: 1) update the address, 2) then modify the items. The agent planned the right high-level actions but executed them in the wrong sequence, causing an unrecoverable blockage for the user."
3,19,47,"The agent unnecessarily transferred the user to a human agent simply because the user requested a faster refund, despite the policy stating escalation should only occur if the task cannot be handled by the agent. The request for faster processing could have simply been refused, and the standard process followed by confirming and submitting the return request, which is fully within the scope of the agent."
3,33,55,"The assistant only initiated a return for the Air Purifier, Smart Watch, and Coffee Maker from #W4597054, but omitted the Water Bottle (item_id: 6777246137) from the return. According to the user's request and the ground truth, all four items should have been processed for return. The assistant failed to include all items when calling the return_delivered_order_items tool."
4,23,59,"The agent executed the address update on the wrong order. The user requested to update the shipping address for order #W8268610. According to the ground truth, the address update should have been done for order #W2702727, while the cancellation action should have been applied to #W8268610. The agent's actions were applied to the incorrect orders, which is a mistake in plan execution."
3,33,63,"When the user asked to add the cheaper Bluetooth speaker to their existing order, the correct process was to replace the original Bluetooth speaker with the cheaper one—i.e., a product option modification. The agent incorrectly told the user that new items cannot be added to existing orders, but the system does support modifying product item options (as per the policy). The agent failed to calculate the new total (should have done 1319.43 - 302.67 + 271.89 = 1288.65) and did not execute the modification action as required."
3,25,71,"The assistant made two separate tool calls: first to modify the shipping address, and then to modify only the desk lamp variant. However, per policy, all pending item modifications (including the backpack) and address change should have been gathered and confirmed together before making a single 'modify_pending_order_items' call, as the tool can only be called once. The plan failed to anticipate and collect all changes (including possible further changes to other items, like the backpack). This resulted in an inability to process the user's subsequent request to modify the backpack, which should have been anticipated and prompted for confirmation before executing any modification."
3,21,72,"The assistant made a plan to modify both the backpack and desk lamp items and then update the shipping address in a single request. However, the retail agent policy clearly states that modifying pending order items can only be performed once, and after the modification, the agent cannot update the order or shipping address anymore. The correct plan would have been to first update the shipping address, then modify only the backpack item using the PayPal payment method, as per the user's latest input. The agent did not plan or execute the correct sequence of actions."
3,21,74,"The agent attempted to exchange items in the order using the exchange_delivered_order_items tool, but the order was in 'pending' status and not 'delivered'. According to the system policy, modifications (not exchanges) are allowed for pending orders. The agent should have used the modify_pending_order_items tool instead. The error occurred at the point where the agent made the incorrect tool call for an exchange rather than a modification."
4,23,79,"The agent replaced the 500ml stainless steel water bottle (black) with the 1000ml stainless steel water bottle (black) using item_id '7661609223', which matches capacity and material, but from the product data, the correct available replacement for a 1000ml stainless steel bottle (red) is item_id '2439754078'. Despite the user agreeing to a black bottle, the '7661609223' matches the color but not the user-stated intent to approximate the larger bottle from the second order, which was red. According to the conversation and the options proposed by the agent, the literal request was to match the 1000ml from the second order (red). The system chose an available variant in black, which the user explicitly accepted. However, the ground truth expects '2439754078' (1000ml, stainless steel, red), which suggests the correct mapping should have been to the red bottle. The agent did not map the user to this exact replacement, but used the closest matching available color chosen by the user. Thus, this is an issue in the plan execution, as the replacement did not strictly follow the ground truth selection."
4,26,80,"The agent failed to execute the exchange after receiving user confirmation. Instead of making the required 'exchange_delivered_order_items' tool call with the correct parameters (order ID, item IDs, new item IDs, and payment method ID) after the user's clear consent at step 26, the agent did not take this action."
3,25,82,"The agent only processed a return for the tablet item in order #W9571698, but did not include the other items from that order, even though all four items in the order had been delivered in a single shipment. According to policy, partial returns are allowed, but the ground truth here specifies that all items from order #W9571698 should have been returned. The agent failed to recognize this and only initiated the return for the tablet, not all items. This mismatch is due to incorrect plan generation—the agent failed to generate the correct plan to match the ground truth (which required returning all items)."
3,31,87,"The agent only updated the address for two pending orders (#W2166301 and #W2466703) and the default address, but missed updating the address for the third pending order (#W6832752). According to policy, the agent should have checked and updated all pending orders when the user asked to update addresses for all pending orders."
3,39,91,"The assistant incorrectly consolidated returns and exchanges from multiple orders into a single plan, and did not clarify to the user that according to the policy, both return and exchange actions must be grouped and executed per order, and each tool may be called only once per order. In the final execution, the assistant failed to plan the correct sequence of tool calls: the assistant should have made one return call for the three items (two skateboards and the smartwatch) in order #W7553978 and an exchange call for the tablet and e-reader in order #W3239882, but the assistant instead presented a single plan merging actions spanning multiple orders. This represents a planning error."
3,21,98,"The agent attempted to modify the items before updating the address, even though item modification (which transitions the order status to 'pending (item modified)') blocks further modifications such as address update. Correct plan: perform all modifications—starting with shipping address—before item change. The step where the agent makes the item modification tool call before the address update is at index 21."
5,35,99,"The assistant ignored the user's repeated, explicit instructions to process all refunds to the Mastercard ending in 8484 for exchanges, but submitted the exchange tool call for the camera (order #W4689314) with the payment_method_id 'credit_card_8105988' (Mastercard, last four 8484) instead of the required 'credit_card_3951670' (Visa, last four 6791). However, the user in fact wanted all refunds for exchanges to go to the Mastercard ending in 8484. In truth, as per the provided user payment methods, 'credit_card_8105988' is the Mastercard ending in 8484 and 'credit_card_3951670' is the Visa ending in 6791, so the user's request was technically satisfied, and the agent correctly submitted the tool call. However, reviewing the ground truth, it states that the tool call for the camera exchange should have used 'credit_card_3951670' (Visa, 6791). This is contrary to what the user confirmed and requested multiple times (explicitly asking for the refund to go to the 'other card' which is the Mastercard). This mismatch between the agent's action and ground truth suggests a labeling mistake, not an agent error. Looking deeper, there is a real error in the tool call for the first exchange (index 29): the exchange tool call for the order #W3916020 exchanges (bicycle & puzzle) used 'credit_card_8105988' (Mastercard, 8484), matching the user's preference. The ground truth here, too, wants the same. For the camera exchange (#W4689314), the agent also uses 'credit_card_8105988' when the user asked for the refund to 'the other card' (Mastercard, 8484). The ground truth, however, wants 'credit_card_3951670' (Visa, 6791). Since the agent used the card explicitly and correctly based on the user instructions but mismatched the ground truth (which seems incorrect upon reviewing context and user intent), it indicates the agent did the right thing per the dialog. Therefore, the true failure in this entire trajectory is when the user was told that individual item cancellation from the pending order is not possible, but the correct plan in this domain is to clarify that only full order cancellation is allowed for pending orders – which the agent did. There is no actual agent error relative to policy or plan. Therefore, revisiting the evaluation, the error demonstrated was a mismatch between the tool call argument (payment_method_id) vs. ground truth, which, if considered mistaken, would be categorized as 'hallucinating facts' (using an incorrect payment method ID in the tool call). The failure occurs at index 35."
