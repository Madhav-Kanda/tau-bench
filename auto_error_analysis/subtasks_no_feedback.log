The assistant successfully updated the shipping address for order #W5056519 to match that of #W8277957.\n2. The assistant successfully modified the Makeup Kit item in order #W5056519 as requested.\n\nHowever, the assistant failed to cancel order #W5995614 as instructed by the user. Instead, the assistant claimed that cancellation was not possible after modifying another pending order and offered to transfer the user to a human agent, but did not perform the cancellation. In the ground truth, the order #W5995614 should have been canceled with the reason \"ordered by mistake.\" Thus, the goal was only partially completed."
